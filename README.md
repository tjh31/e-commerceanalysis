# E-commerce Shopper Purchase Prediction & Analysis

## Problem Statement:
Marketing teams constantly strive to optimize their promotions, pricing, personalization, and campaigns to increase customer acquisition, retention, and revenue. However, identifying the most effective strategies can be challenging. Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze past customer behavior and predict future outcomes based on various marketing strategies.

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer visiting an online shopping website will make a purchase or not. This prediction can help marketing teams in optimizing their promotions, pricing, personalization, and campaigns to increase the likelihood of purchase and ultimately, revenue.

## Justification and Source of Dataset:
The "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset" from UCI Machine Learning Repository is a suitable dataset for this problem statement. This dataset contains various features related to user behavior on an online shopping website, such as the number of pages visited, the duration of the visit, and the type of traffic source. The dataset also includes a binary label indicating whether the user made a purchase or not.

This dataset is suitable for solving this problem because it provides insights into various factors that influence the purchasing decision of users on an online shopping website. By analyzing this data, machine learning models can learn to identify the most effective marketing strategies for increasing the likelihood of purchase.

## Key Highlights:
### Traffic Analysis:
- Discovered that Traffic Type 2 and Traffic Type 3 stand out as the most profitable traffic sources.
- Visitors from Traffic Type 2 exhibit higher average page values, lower bounce rates, and exit rates, indicating a higher level of engagement.
- Traffic Type 2 proves to be a valuable traffic source for revenue generation.

### Special Days:
